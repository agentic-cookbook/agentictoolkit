"""Keep the mtime of a generated file that a rerun reproduced byte-for-byte.

Every generator in this directory rewrites its destination unconditionally: the two
Python ones call `write_text` at the end of a full render, and `gen_schema.py` hands
the path to `openapi-typescript`, which does the same. A rerun that changes nothing
therefore still stamps a fresh mtime — and that is not cosmetic, because these files
are INPUTS to their package's bundle.

`dist_staleness()` in adh's `tools/shared_vendor.py` reads "a source file newer than
the newest thing in dist/" as "this dist is a rollback" — the guard that caught
`b892a088a` shipping a status container which died at startup on an ESM SyntaxError.
adh's `ci.yml` runs `pnpm gen` AFTER `build_shared_deps.py` has built `dist/`, so an
unconditional rewrite makes both backends' vendored-freshness checks fail on a tree
where not one byte has drifted, and hands the reader a remedy that cannot work: the
prescribed `pnpm build:shared` is content-gated, sees no source change, and skips.

So: snapshot the output, and hand the original mtime back to a file the run
reproduced exactly. Content behaviour is unchanged — a real change is still written,
so each generator's `git diff --exit-code` drift gate still fires.

This is the same fix `external/agenticdevelopertoolkit/packages/web/packages/themes/scripts/build-tokens.mjs` carries for Style
Dictionary's identical habit, at the one other seam in this workspace where a
generator writes into a package's `src/`.
