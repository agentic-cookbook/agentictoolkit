 *
 * This list used to be kept by hand here, "measured from those files", and it
 * drifted the moment the package grew a token: `--lp-font-serif` — the tour's
 * closing promise, the one non-mono line in the deck — was read by
 * `blocks.css` and missing from the list, so the bridge never assigned it and
 * three tour pages shipped in the package's `Georgia, serif` fallback while
 * every assertion here passed. A hand-kept vocabulary drifts silently by
 * construction; the only fix is not to keep one.
 *
 * Read from the sibling package's `src/` rather than through `require.resolve`
 * because `src/` is what a person edits — `dist/css` is a verbatim copy made
 * by `build:css`, so resolving the dependency would only add a build step
 * between the edit and the failing test.
