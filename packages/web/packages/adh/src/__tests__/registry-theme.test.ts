 * The bridge under test, and the two package stylesheets whose token contract it
 * completes: `--rp-*` from the registry profile renderer, `--rf-*` from the
 * registry field editors.
 *
 * Read from each package's `src/` rather than through `require.resolve`, for
 * `landing-bridge.test.ts`'s reason: `src/` is what a person edits, and `dist`
 * is a verbatim copy made by `build:css`, so resolving the dependency would only
 * put a build step between the edit and the failing test. `registry-profile`
 * lives in the `agenticdevelopertoolkit` submodule and adh does not depend on it
 * — but `@agentic-toolkit/registry`'s own `profile.css` is a bare passthrough
 * (`@import '@agenticdevelopertoolkit/registry-profile/css/profile.css'`), so
 * the tokens exist in exactly one file and this is it. Nothing here imports it;
 * it is read as text.
