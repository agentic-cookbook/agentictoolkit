/**
 * This site's section of a principal's profile at `/<slug>/profile` — declared as
 * `profileSection` on `frontend/src/sites/personas/src/home-model.tsx` (the `SiteHomeModel`
 * field documented in `@agentic-toolkit/adh/home`).
 *
 * `ProfileView` (`packages/web/packages/adh/src/profile/ProfileView.tsx:84`) renders `UserCard`
 * directly above whatever this returns, and `UserCard` already draws a `Personas` section
 * (`packages/web/packages/ui/src/blocks/user-card.tsx:333-360`) listing each persona's `name`, a
 * `Badge` for its `visibility`, and its `description`. Repeating those here would be the same
 * list twice, one scroll apart, so this section renders what the card does NOT: each persona's
 * public ADDRESS — where to go and read it. That is genuinely this site's own contribution; the
 * card states attributes, this says where.
 *
 * Fetches nothing: `principal.personas` is already part of the public card both principal
 * endpoints return (`UserCardDto.personas`, `user-card.tsx:62`), and `ProfilePrincipal.personas`
 * carries it through non-optionally, so there is no data layer to add for a roster already in the
 * prop. The roster is already audience-filtered by the backend, so this renders every entry it
 * was handed and makes no visibility decision of its own — in particular it does NOT filter on
 * `visibility` to try to guess which links will resolve.
 *
 * A persona is not addressable on THIS site — agenticdeveloperpersonas.com is where personas are
 * defined (its registry entry reads `description: 'Define your personas'`,
 * `packages/web/packages/adh-registry/src/sites/registry.ts:221`), not where they are read.
 * Public personas are read on `personaregistry` (`agenticpersonaregistry.com`), so the link is
 * built with that package's own helpers rather than a hand-rolled host or path:
 * `registryUserPersonaPath` (`registry.ts:907`) is "the address that says whose it is" — the
 * owner-scoped form `/<owner>/<persona>` — and `siteUrl` (`registry.ts:933`) resolves the right
 * host for the current environment (local suite / testing / staging / prod).
 *
 * The host comes from `useClientHost` (`@agentic-toolkit/adh/header`) — `null` on the server AND
 * on the first client render, the real host once mounted — rather than a direct
 * `globalThis.location` read. This component carries `'use client'`, but a client component still
 * renders on the SERVER first, where `location` is undefined: a direct read would make the server
 * see `''` and the first client render see the real host, disagreeing on every `href` here and
 * logging a hydration error. `ProfileView`, the component that renders this one as its
 * `children`, guards its own `Full Profile` link the same way and says so. `siteProdUrl` is a
 * correct absolute URL in every environment — just not the environment-local one — so the
 * pre-mount render is never broken, only less local until the post-mount re-render.
 *
 * A link built this way is not a promise the recipient can open it — a `hub`-visibility persona
 * resolves for a signed-in viewer and 404s for an anonymous one. That is carried over from
 * `personaProfileUrl`'s own caveat and applies here verbatim; it is not corrected by filtering the
 * roster, since the backend already audience-filtered what it returned.
