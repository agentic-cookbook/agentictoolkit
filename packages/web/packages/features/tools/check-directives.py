"""Assert which built entries are `'use client'` modules — TRANSITIVELY.

Run from a feature package's root (its `build` script does):

    python3 ../tools/check-directives.py

It reads that package's own `directives` map out of its `package.json`:

    "directives": {
      "index": "client",                                 # must carry the directive
      "parse-path": ["@agentic-toolkit/categories/chain"]  # must not, and may import only these
    }

`"client"` means `dist/<entry>.js` must open with `'use client'`. A LIST means
the opposite — the entry is SERVER-SAFE: neither it nor anything reachable from
it may carry the directive, and the only bare specifiers it may import are the
ones listed. Sibling `@agentic-toolkit/*` specifiers are RESOLVED (through the
package's own `node_modules` symlink and the target's `exports` map, `import`
condition) and walked, so the check crosses package boundaries the same way the
runtime does.

WHY THIS EXISTS AS A CHECK RATHER THAN A COMMENT
------------------------------------------------
`esbuild-plugin-preserve-directives` propagates a chunk's directive to every
entry that imports it, so a package barrel that re-exports one client component
becomes a whole-file client module. Every export in it — a plain string constant
included — then reaches a React Server Component as an opaque CLIENT REFERENCE
rather than as its value. Nothing throws. `segments.indexOf(CHAIN_SEPARATOR)`
compares a string against a reference object, never matches, and returns -1.

That is how research deep links shipped broken. `features/research`'s
`parse-path` entry was correctly built as its own directive-free chunk, but it
imported `CHAIN_SEPARATOR` from the `@agentic-toolkit/categories` BARREL — a
whole-file `'use client'` module — and the toolkit packages are `external` in
this build, so that import survived verbatim into the shipped server chunk and
was resolved inside the caller's RSC. `/<ws>/research/work/-/doc-1` parsed as
the category chain `["work", "-", "doc-1"]` with no document open: every deep
link and every refresh on an open document, silently wrong.

`tsc`, ESLint and vitest cannot see this at all — in all three the import is an
ordinary string, because none of them enforces the client/server boundary — and
`next build` does not see it either, since a Client Component is a legal thing to
be. The only observable difference is the first line of a built file and the
import list beneath it. Hence a check, and hence the transitive walk: asserting
only the entry's own first line would have passed on the broken build.

Sibling of `external/agenticdevelopertoolkit/packages/web/packages/landing/tools/check-directives.py`, which asserts the same
property for a package whose entries are declared in its own tsup config.
