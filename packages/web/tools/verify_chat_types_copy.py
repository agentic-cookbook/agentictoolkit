"""Assert `@agentic-toolkit/adh`'s copied chat contract still matches its source.

`packages/adh/src/persona-chat/chat-types.ts` is a VERBATIM copy of type declarations
that live in `@agenticdevelopertoolkit/chat`. Its own header explains why it is a copy
rather than a dependency: that package is in a different submodule, and this toolkit is
consumed by repos that have neither adh nor that submodule, so a `link:` would resolve
only in a checkout that happens to hold both. Both uses (`persona-chat/index.ts`,
`visitor-chat/sse.ts`) are TYPE-ONLY, so the declarations erase at build time and a
structural copy is exact.

That reasoning holds only while the copy is actually a copy. Nothing about a stale one
is loud: TypeScript keeps compiling — a consumer's real backend simply satisfies a shape
this repo believes is current, and the mismatch surfaces at runtime as a missing field
rather than as a type error. This guard is the thing that makes the duplication safe,
and it is the "must follow" in that header turned into a check.

## What is and isn't drift

Every declaration in the COPY must appear in a source file, byte-for-byte (modulo blank
lines and trailing whitespace). The reverse is deliberately NOT required: the source
declares more than the contract needs — `ChatMode` is chat's own rendering concern — and
copying types this package does not use would be the duplication people fear, not the
narrow one that is justified. A declaration in the copy that no source declares is an
error: this file is not a place to define types.

The parser treats a declaration as running from its `export interface|type NAME` line to
the next top-level `export`. Anything non-exported wedged between two exports therefore
lands inside the preceding declaration and reads as drift — a false alarm, but in the
safe direction, and neither file has ever had such a thing.

Exit codes: 0 in sync · 1 drift · 2 the guard could not find what it checks.
